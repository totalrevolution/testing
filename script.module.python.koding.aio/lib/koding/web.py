def Download(url, dest, dp = None):
    """
This will download a file, currently this has to be a standard download link which doesn't require cookies/login.

CODE: koding.Download(src,dst,[dp])
dp is optional, by default it is set to false

AVAILABLE PARAMS:

    (*) src  - This is the source file, the URL to your download. If you attempted to download an item but it's not behaving the way you think it should (e.g. a zip file not unzipping) then change the extension of the downloaded file to .txt and open up in a text editor. You'll most likely find it's just a piece of text that was returned from the URL you gave and it should have details explaining why it failed. Could be that's the wrong URL, it requires some kind of login, it only accepts certain user-agents etc.

    (*) dst  - This is the destination file, make sure it's a physical path and not "special://...". Also remember you need to add the actual filename to the end of the path, so if we were downloading something to the "downloads" folder and we wanted the file to be called "test.txt" we would use this path: dst = "downloads/test.txt". Of course the downloads folder would actually need to exist otherwise it would fail and based on this poor example the downloads folder would be at root level of your device as we've not specified a path prior to that so it just uses the first level that's accessible.

    dp - This is optional, if you pass through the dp function as a DialogProgress() then you'll get to see the progress of the download. If you choose not to add this paramater then you'll just get a busy spinning circle icon until it's completed. See the example below for a dp example.

EXAMPLE CODE:
src = 'http://noobsandnerds.com/python_koding/my_first_addon.zip'
dst = xbmc.translatePath('special://home/my_first_addon.zip')
dp = xbmcgui.DialogProgress()

If you need to pull the contents of a webpage it's very simple to do so by using this function.

CODE:   koding.Open_URL(url,[post_type,headers,cookies,auth,timeout,cookiejar])

AVAILABLE PARAMS:

    url  -  This is the main url you want to send through. Send it through
    as a query string format even if it's a post.

    post_type  -  By default this is set to 'get' but this can be set to 'post',
    if set to post the query string will be split up into a post format automatically.
    
    headers -  Optionally send through headers in form of a dictionary.

    cookies  -  If set to true your request will send through and store cookies.

    auth  -  User/pass details

    timeout  -  Optionally set a timeout for the request.

    cookiejar  -  An name for the location to store cookies. By default it's
    set to addon_data/<addon_id>/cookies/cookiejar but if you have multiple
    websites you access then you may want to use a separate filename for each site.
